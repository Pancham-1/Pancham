### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Pancham
#### Beginner Programmer


I am a student who is trying out different programming projects and languages. Through this platform I would like to share some of the projects that I have made and learn more about software development from the github community.
I have made some basic projects that would be helpful for starters. These includes a BMI Calculator, Rock/Paper/Scissors Game, Personal Shopping Cart etc. 

Skills: PYTHON / HTML / CSS/ JS

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Javascript 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Project ideas that have real life implications 
- âš¡ Fun fact: There are more than 700 coding languages out there.
